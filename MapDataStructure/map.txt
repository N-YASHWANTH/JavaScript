Maps:

->This is similar to that of Objects.

->A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype.

->A Map has a property that represents the size of the map.

There are Many Methods in Map DataStructure:

->new Map() : This is used to create new Map Object.
let costOfItems=new map([
    ["Biscuit",5rs]
    ["Chocolate",10rs]
    ["Chips",20rs]
])

->set() : This is used to set the value to the key in the Map.
let costOfItems=new map()
costOfItems.set("Biscuit",5rs)
costOfItems.set("Chocolate",10rs)
costOfItems.set("Chips",20rs)

->get() : This is used to get the value of the key in the Map.
costOfItems.set("Biscuit")

->clear() : This is used to remove all the elements from the map.
costOfItems.clear()

->delete() : This is used to delete the entry specified by key.
costOfItems.delete("Biscuit")

->has() : This is used to check whether the key is present or not. It returns true if it is present else return false.
costOfItems.set("Chips")

->entries() : This is used to return all the entries present in the map.
costOfItems.entries()

->foreach() : This is used to iterate over map Object.
costOfItems.foreach((values,keys)=>{
    console.log(keys," ---> ",values)
})

->keys() : This is used to return all the keys present in the map.
costOfItems.keys()

->values() : This is used to return all the values present in the map.
costOfItems.values()

->There is also a property named as size that is used to find the size of map.

The main difference between Object and Map is:

Object:                                                             Maps:

->Not Directly Iterable.                                           ->Directly Iterable.
->No size property.                                                ->Size Property is present.
->Keys must be Strings.                                            ->Keys can be of any Datatype.
->Keys are not well ordered.                                       ->Keys are Ordered by insertion.
->Have default keys.                                               ->Do not have Default Keys.
