-> MVC is abbrevated as Model View Controller.

->These are divided into 3 sections Model, View and Controller.

Model:
->This is used to handle the logic.
->This interacts with the Database.

View:
->This is used to handle Data Presentation.
->Dynamically reduced.

Controller:
->This is used to handle the request flow.
->This never handles Data Logic.

->Firstly, when user sends the request the request will be passed to controller layer.
->Then the Controller layer sends the request to the Model layer, which returns the data.
->The Controller receives the data and sends it to the View Layer.
->The view layer is responsible for how to present the data.
->This presented data from the view layer is send back to the Controller layer.
->The Controller will send that presented data back to the user.
