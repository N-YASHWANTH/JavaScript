Hoisting:

->Making the use of variables before declaration & initialization is called as Hoisting.

->The process of getting the output as "undefined" is known as successful hoisting.

->Hoisting can be achieved only with var variables,because it belongs to global scope 
  where,the result is "Undefined".

->Hoisting cannot be achieved with let & const variables,because they belong to script scope.
