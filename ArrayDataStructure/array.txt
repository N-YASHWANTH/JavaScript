*Array:

->An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value
ex: let cars = ["Audi", "Volvo", "BMW"]

Why we use Array?
->When we have to store multiple values into a single variable then we use array.

*Creating an Array:
->Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

*Syntax:
let array_name = [item1, item2, ...];

->You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

ex:
let cars = []
cars[0]= "Audi"
cars[1]= "Volvo"
cars[2]= "BMW"

->Using the JavaScript Keyword new

ex:
let cars = new Array("Benz", "Volvo", "BMW")

*Accessing Array Elements
->You cab access an array element by referring to the index number:

let car = cars[0]

*Changing an Array Element
->This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:

cars[0] = "Thar"
