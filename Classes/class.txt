Classes:

->JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.

->Use the keyword class to create a class.

->Class has a special method called as constructor, this is mainly used to initiaze object properties.

Syntax:

class ClassName {
  constructor() { 
    ...
    }
}

->We can create Objects using class.

The Constructor Method

The constructor method is a special method:

->It has to have the exact name "constructor".

->It is executed automatically when a new object is created.

->It is used to initialize object properties.

->If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.

Class Methods

->Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

->Always add a constructor() method.

->Then add any number of methods.

Syntax:

class ClassName {
  constructor() { 
    ... 
    }

  method_1() { 
    ... 
    }

  method_2() { 
    ... 
    }

  method_3() { 
    ... 
    }
}
