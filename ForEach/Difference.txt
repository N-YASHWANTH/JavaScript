Foreach

Foreach takes a callback function 
and run that callback function on each element of array one by one.
Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array 
and providing you array elements to do operations on them.


Foreach vs Filter

The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array 
and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. 
If the value is true element remains in the resulting array 
but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.

Also take notice filter does not update the existing array 
it will return a new filtered array every time.


ForEach vs Map vs Filter

Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array 
but whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.

The provided callback to map modifies the array elements and save them into the new array upon completion 
that array get returned as the mapped array.


Reduce

As the name already suggest reduce method of the array object 
is used to reduce the array to one single value.

So that is how reduce works it reduces the array 
into one single value and returns it upon completion.
